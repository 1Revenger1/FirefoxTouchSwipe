# Firefox TouchSwipe

I wanted an arrow when going back and forth tabs, and also try to create better logic to reduce the number of mis-history-travelling (is that even a word?)
Don't know if I'll put it on the firefox addon store...
Made this in like a day

Btw it's way to easy to make modifications to web pages from an addon and do stuff...
